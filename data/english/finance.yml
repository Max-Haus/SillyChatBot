- - Hello, I need to open a savings bank account.
  - Sure sir. Please come with me.
- - Alright.
  - Let me first inform you that we have a savings account named ‘Life’s Good 722’ with many more benefits than a regular savings account. Would you like to opt for that?
- - Yeah sure. But would you please tell me what type of benefits will be provided with the ‘Life’s good 722’ savings account?
  - Sure sir. We have a common bank app in which you will be registered through this special savings account that will customize benefits for you. With the bank app, you can check your balance, change your password, apply for a loan, apply for a debit or credit card, checkbook, license, and many more services like these.
- - Wow! This will make my work much easier. I will not have to physically come to the bank every now and then! I can operate through this app itself!
  - Exactly!

  - You will receive your debit card and your checkbook in a period of two days. It will be delivered to your doorstep. Let me also inform you that you can make a transaction of Rs.50,000 through your checkbook per month. Rest other transactions can be carried out through your debit and credit cards.
- - Alright. That’s fair. And, is there a limit on carrying transactions through debit cards?
  - Yes sir. With a regular debit card, you can withdraw an amount through the bank’s ATM five times a month and three times through any other bank.
- - Okay that should be enough. Is my account ready to use?
  - Yes, I have opened the ‘Life’s Good 722’ savings account for you, sir. You will receive a confirmation email in the evening after which you can use that account. And, you will have to make your first debit card transaction through an ATM to activate your card.
